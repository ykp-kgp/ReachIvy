## Installation

### Step 1: Setting Up a Virtual Environment

Before installing the project dependencies, it's recommended to create a virtual environment. This ensures that the dependencies required for your project are isolated from your global Python environment.

1. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt**: Navigate to your project directory.

2. **Create the Virtual Environment**:
   - For Windows:
     ```sh
     python -m venv env
     ```
   - For macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     python3 -m venv env
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - For Windows:
     ```sh
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS and Linux:
     ```sh
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

   After activation, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that you are now working inside the virtual environment.

### Step 2: Installing Packages from `requirements.txt`

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

1. **Ensure the Virtual Environment is Activated**:
   - The virtual environment should be active as indicated by the changed prompt. If not, follow the activation step from Step 1.

2. **Install the Packages**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
