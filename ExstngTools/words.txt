Oman's wondrous 1700 kilometer coastline glitters with stunning beaches. Unlike Dubai, Oman does not have many entertainment options, and families often barbecue, picnic, or camp out at these beaches. Unfortunately, this has led to environmental degradation. Beaches are now marked by charcoal pits and the bones of slaughtered goats, while sea creatures swallow plastic bags and die. Plastics, cans and rubber products 4 5 take centuries 6 to decompose and release harmful chemicals that infiltrate the groundwater, kill sea life and destroy the soil.

The Municipality maintains two or three major beaches within the city limits, but this is not enough. As dutiful members of the community we need to educate citizens and catalyze an attitudinal change. I propose to leverage the government, social media, and corporations to spread awareness and bring about a paradigm shift in addressing environmental harm. By involving all stakeholders, this approach has the potential to bring about a 8 long term solution, rather than a one-time “clean-the-beach campaign!

First, I would organize a signature drive to petition the government to improve infrastructure. Demarcating and developing areas along beach sides for use as cooking areas and installing litter baskets will limit littering and enable regular garbage collection! The government is a necessary actor in this movement to save the environment, as it has the manpower, resources, legal authority and the ability to comprehensively address these issues.

Technology and social networking sites are an effective means of mass communication that can spread awareness and transform mindsets. I would start a "Save Our Beaches" campaign on a social media platform, calling on people to post photos of the terrible state of Oman’s beaches. Social media will not only help to reach out to a larger section of society, but will also help to bring this issue to the attention of the youth who are the leaders of the next generation.

Finally, I would also start an "Adopt a Beach" campaign to persuade local companies, especially hotels, to assume responsibility for maintaining and cleaning the beach. By inviting the private sector, which has ample resources to add to this campaign, we will establish a mutually beneficial relationship wherein companies can serve a social cause while simultaneously improving their brand visibility. This approach calls on the government, companies and citizens to ensure the continuous maintenance of a natural resource of this country: its beautiful beaches. The surest way to realize a goal is for all sections of society to engage multiple actors to work in harmony to see it through.
